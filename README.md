### Hi there
My name is Alice and I do things with technology, I don't release a lot of projects.
The ones I do might be useful.

- Contact me on IRC: quarkyalice (irc.libera.chat)
- Email: quarkyalice@disroot.org, I may be slow to reply but it's a reliable way to reach me.
- On Discord I don't take direct messages from unknown senders.
- Pronouns: she/her
